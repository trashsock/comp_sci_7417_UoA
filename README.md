Automated text classification

This repo contains the development of a knowledge base system to automatically categorise natural language processing problem-solution pairs from 20,534 Stack Overflow posts, collected via the Stack Exchange API. Visualisations such as word clouds and n-grams reveal key patterns and relationships in the dataset. Using a hybrid method of unsupervised clustering (K-Means, TF-IDF) and rule-based classification, the system organises pre-processed data into thematic categories like library issues, vocabulary management, and model performance.
